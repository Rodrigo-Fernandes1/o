# Evaluation-of-Deep-Learning-Models-in-Search-by-Example-using-Capsule-Endoscopy-Images
## Description
This repository contains the code and materials related to the project of evaluation of deep learning models for localization of annotated frames in capsule endoscopy videos. The main goal of this project is to propose an innovative methodology that utilizes pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Euclidean distance to automate the identification of annotated frames in wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) videos.
